Before you can forge gems onto a tool, it has to have at least one empty gem slot.

**Empty Gem Slots**

---

In this modpack gem slots are bound to [rarity tiers](^aged:tools_and_weapons/tiers):

- {dark_gray}0{} slot = {#A2A2A2}common{}
- {dark_gray}1{} slot = {#47DF42}uncommon{}
- {dark_gray}2{} slot = {#3989A7}rare{}
- {dark_gray}3{} slot = {#C51EE3}epic{}
- {dark_gray}4{} slot = {#DEA137}legendary{}
- {dark_gray}5{} slot = {#DE3798}unique{}

{gray}// You can't add gem slots on your own!{}

{gray}// rerolling rarity doesn't affect the gem slots.{}

**Gem Drops**

---

Killing hostile entities is the way to go.

They have a small chance for gem drops.


Stronger mobs drop a higher gem than low bobs.


Example Drops:

- I   Gem = Zombie
- III  Gem = Evoker
- V   Gem = Void Shadow

;;;;;


**Hammer Drops**

---

Smither & Extraction Hammers are only obtainable in treasure chests.


They also each come in 4 variants.

;;;;;


**Link Gems**

---

For this you need the Smither / Link Hammer.


Use the Smithing Table to link gems.



;;;;;


**Unlink Gems**

---

For this you need the Extraction / Unlink Hammer.


Use the Grinder to unlink gems.


{gray}// If you use no hammer - all gems will get extracted.{}
